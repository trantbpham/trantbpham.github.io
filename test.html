      <div class="col-4">Interestingly, success students rated coronavirus as having a larger impact on their college plans/experience than Transition students. This is likely because success students, most of whom were already enrolled in college, likely had to return home. Transition students, who are still in high school, were still living at home at the time so were less impacted.</div>
